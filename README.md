## üõ†Ô∏è Development Platform

This project is being developed using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), a visual React development environment that integrates directly with GitHub.

- Bolt is connected to the GitHub repo and reads/writes code automatically.
- All component and UI logic is generated and refined inside Bolt.
- We use Bolt for rapid prototyping and layout, but GitHub and local VS Code remain the source of truth.
