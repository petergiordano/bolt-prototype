# üîÅ Three-Way Workflow: Bolt + GitHub + Local VS Code

This file documents the operating model for managing code contributions and project updates between Bolt.new, GitHub, and your local VS Code development environment.

## üß≠ Source of Truth

The **GitHub repo is the single source of truth** for this project.

- Bolt pushes code directly into the connected GitHub repo.
- You work locally from the latest state in GitHub.
- All updates (from Bolt or local work) must be committed and pushed to GitHub to stay in sync.
- The local GitHub repo is preferred for editing `.md` files and AI-assisted workflows, since it enables sharing and collaboration via ChatGPT.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local VS Code Workflow

### 1. Pull latest changes from GitHub before making any edits

```bash
git pull origin bolt-migration  # or your active working branch

2. Make your edits

Work locally in VS Code as usual (e.g. editing markdown, styling, components, Supabase queries).

3. Stage and commit changes

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change here"

4. Push to GitHub

git push origin bolt-migration

This keeps both your local project and the Bolt interface in sync with the GitHub cloud repo ‚Äî the canonical source of truth.
